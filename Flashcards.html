      { domain: "1.0", question: "What is hashing?", answer: "Hashing is a one-way cryptographic function that converts data into a fixed-size string of characters, commonly used for password storage and data integrity verification." },
      { domain: "2.0", question: "What is phishing?", answer: "Phishing is a social engineering attack where attackers impersonate legitimate entities via email or other communication to trick victims into revealing sensitive information or installing malware." },
      { domain: "3.0", question: "What is a VPN?", answer: "A Virtual Private Network creates an encrypted tunnel over a public network, allowing secure remote access and protecting data in transit." },
      { domain: "4.0", question: "What is vulnerability scanning?", answer: "Vulnerability scanning is the automated process of identifying security weaknesses in systems, applications, and networks." },
      { domain: "5.0", question: "What is data classification?", answer: "Data classification is the process of categorizing data based on sensitivity and criticality to determine appropriate security controls and handling procedures." },
      { domain: "1.0", question: "What is non-repudiation?", answer: "Non-repudiation ensures that a party cannot deny the authenticity of their signature or the sending of a message, typically achieved through digital signatures." },
      { domain: "2.0", question: "What is malware?", answer: "Malware is malicious software designed to damage, disrupt, or gain unauthorized access to computer systems, including viruses, worms, trojans, ransomware, and spyware." },
      { domain: "3.0", question: "What is a firewall?", answer: "A firewall is a network security device that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing traffic based on predetermined security rules." },
      { domain: "4.0", question: "What is penetration testing?", answer: "Penetration testing is an authorized simulated cyber attack to evaluate system security by identifying exploitable vulnerabilities." },
      { domain: "5.0", question: "What is compliance?", answer: "Compliance refers to adherence to laws, regulations, standards, and internal policies that govern an organization's security and privacy practices." },
      { domain: "1.0", question: "What is encryption at rest?", answer: "Encryption at rest protects stored data by converting it into an unreadable format, requiring a decryption key to access." },
      { domain: "2.0", question: "What is ransomware?", answer: "Ransomware is malware that encrypts victim files and demands payment for the decryption key, often threatening data deletion or publication." },
      { domain: "3.0", question: "What is the purpose of access control lists (ACLs)?", answer: "ACLs define permissions for network resources, specifying which users or systems can access specific resources and what actions they can perform." },
      { domain: "4.0", question: "What is security orchestration?", answer: "Security orchestration automates and coordinates security tools and processes to improve incident response efficiency and consistency." },
      { domain: "5.0", question: "What is a risk assessment?", answer: "Risk assessment is the process of identifying, analyzing, and evaluating security risks to determine their potential impact and likelihood." },
      { domain: "1.0", question: "What is a digital certificate?", answer: "A digital certificate is an electronic document that uses a digital signature to bind a public key with an identity, verifying the authenticity of the certificate holder." },
      { domain: "2.0", question: "What is SQL injection?", answer: "SQL injection is an attack technique that exploits vulnerabilities in database queries by inserting malicious SQL code to access or manipulate data." },
      { domain: "3.0", question: "What is defense in depth?", answer: "Defense in depth is a security strategy that uses multiple layers of security controls throughout an IT system to provide redundancy if one layer fails." },
      { domain: "4.0", question: "What is a security baseline?", answer: "A security baseline is a minimum set of security controls and configurations that must be applied to systems to ensure adequate protection." },
      { domain: "5.0", question: "What is a privacy policy?", answer: "A privacy policy is a legal document that explains how an organization collects, uses, stores, and protects personal information." },
      { domain: "1.0", question: "What is steganography?", answer: "Steganography is the practice of hiding information within other non-secret data, such as embedding messages in images or audio files." },
